Day 09 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Triple Integrals.
DM Topic: Number Theory: Bezout's Identity and Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
DS Topic: Binary Subtraction using 2's Complement.

Digital Product:
- DE: Compute the volume of a simple 3D shape (e.g., a tetrahedron) using a triple integral solver.
- DM: Python function for the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find x, y such that ax+by = GCD(a, b).
- DS: Design and simulate a 4-bit binary subtractor using Full-Adders and 2's complement.
