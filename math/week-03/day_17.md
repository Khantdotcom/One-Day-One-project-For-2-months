Day 17 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Higher-Order DE: Nonhomogeneous Equations (Method of Undetermined Coefficients).
DM Topic: Combinatorics: Permutations and Combinations.
DS Topic: SR and D Flip-Flops.

Digital Product:
- DE: Solve two nonhomogeneous DEs using the Method of Undetermined Coefficients and document the steps.
- DM: Python script to solve 5 combinatorics problems involving permutations and combinations.
- DS: Simulate the SR latch and the D flip-flop, demonstrating their characteristic equations and state tables.
