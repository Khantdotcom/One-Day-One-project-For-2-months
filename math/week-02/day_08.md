Day 08 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Double Integrals over General Regions (Changing Order of Integration).
DM Topic: Number Theory: GCD using Euclid's Algorithm.
DS Topic: Half-Adder and Full-Adder Circuits.

Digital Product:
- DE: Write a numerical integrator to compute a double integral over a non-rectangular region (Python/SymPy/NumPy).
- DM: Python implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm to find GCD(a, b).
- DS: Implement and simulate a Full-Adder circuit from scratch using basic gates.
