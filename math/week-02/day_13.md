Day 13 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: First-Order DE: Linear Equations (Integrating Factor).
DM Topic: Relations: Binary Relations and Properties (Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive).
DS Topic: Demultiplexers (DEMUX) and Data Distribution.

Digital Product:
- DE: Python script that calculates and applies the integrating factor to solve a linear first-order DE.
- DM: Implement a checker function in Python to test if a given binary relation has the three properties.
- DS: Simulate a 1-to-8 DEMUX and use it to route data to different outputs.
