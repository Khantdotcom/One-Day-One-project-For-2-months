📅 60-Day Integrated Study and Project Plan

This folder contains a 60-day integrated study/project cycle cycling through Differential Equations & Calculus (DE), Discrete Math & Proofs (DM), and Digital Systems & Logic (DS). Files are organized into `week-01` .. `week-09`. Each `day_XX.md` contains the day's topics and the targeted digital product deliverable.

Structure:
- Phase 1 (Days 1–20): Foundations and Prerequisite Calculus
- Phase 2 (Days 21–40): Advanced Techniques and Discrete Structures
- Phase 3 (Days 41–60): Integration and Advanced Project Work

Use the per-day files to guide daily work and produce small deliverables (code, proofs, simulations, HDL modules, reports).
