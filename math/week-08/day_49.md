Day 49 — DM/DS Integration

Project: GCD Hardware Logic (DM/DS Focus): Outline the sequential steps (a state machine) for finding the GCD of two numbers using repeated subtraction.

Digital Product:
- Analyze the Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD using repeated subtraction.
- Design a state machine (Moore or Mealy) that implements the algorithm.
- Outline states: INIT, COMPARE, SUBTRACT, DONE.
- Create a state diagram and state transition table.
- Document the control signals (load, subtract, reset) and condition tests.
