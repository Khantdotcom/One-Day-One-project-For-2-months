Day 52 — DE/Programming

Project: RK4 Solver: Python function that uses the RK4 method to numerically solve a first-order DE and compares the result to the analytical solution.

Digital Product:
- Build a full RK4 solver that integrates a first-order ODE over a time interval.
- Solve a non-trivial ODE (e.g., dy/dt = y*cos(t) or dy/dt = sin(y)) using the RK4 method.
- Compare the numerical solution to an analytical or reference solution (from scipy or SymPy).
- Generate plots showing both solutions overlaid, with error quantification.
- Experiment with different step sizes and document the effect on accuracy.
