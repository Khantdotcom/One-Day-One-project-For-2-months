Day 60 — All Subjects Wrap-up

Product: Learning Synthesis: Final detailed document mapping key concepts from each course to programming/engineering disciplines (e.g., DE → Control Systems; DM → Database Logic; DS → FPGA/Microcontrollers).

Digital Product:
- Create a comprehensive "concept map" or synthesis document.
- Map DE concepts to real-world applications: Laplace transforms → frequency domain analysis, signal processing; ODEs → control systems (PID controllers), population modeling.
- Map DM concepts to computer science: proofs → formal verification, algorithms → correctness analysis, graph theory → network design, complexity → performance optimization.
- Map DS concepts to hardware: digital logic → FPGA/ASIC design, sequential circuits → microcontroller state machines, HDL → hardware description and synthesis.
- Include case studies or examples showing how concepts from the three subjects integrate in a real engineering project (e.g., designing a digital controller for a physical system).
- Outline future learning pathways and advanced topics in each subject.
