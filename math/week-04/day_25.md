Day 25 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Systems of Linear Differential Equations (Matrix Form).
DM Topic: Graph Theory: Trees (Properties and Spanning Trees).
DS Topic: Sequential Circuit Design (State Diagram → Circuit).

Digital Product:
- DE: Write a Python function to set up the coefficient matrix A and vector f(t) for a given system.
- DM: Python script to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a small weighted graph using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
- DS: Design and simulate a sequential circuit that detects the sequence "01" (using D-FFs).
