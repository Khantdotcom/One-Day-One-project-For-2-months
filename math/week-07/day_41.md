Day 41 — DE/DS Integration

Project: Laplace/Circuit Analysis: Solve an RLC circuit's differential equation using Laplace Transform (DE focus).

Digital Product:
- Derive the differential equation for an RLC circuit from Kirchhoff's voltage law.
- Apply the Laplace Transform to convert the differential equation to an algebraic equation.
- Solve for the voltage/current transfer function and perform frequency analysis.
- Document the mathematical solution with plots of the frequency response.
