Day 51 — DE/Programming

Project: Runge-Kutta Implementation (DE Focus): Implement the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) from scratch.

Digital Product:
- Code the RK4 algorithm from scratch (without scipy.integrate.odeint).
- Create a function with the signature: rk4(f, t, y, h) that advances the solution by one step.
- Test with a simple ODE where an analytical solution exists (e.g., dy/dt = -y or dy/dt = 2t).
- Verify accuracy by comparing to the analytical solution.
- Document the algorithm, step size selection, and error analysis.
