Day 48 — DS/HDL/Programming

Project: Verilog/VHDL Module: Write the HDL code for the combinational part of the 4-bit ALU (ADD, SUB, AND, OR).

Digital Product:
- Write a parameterized Verilog or VHDL module for the 4-bit ALU.
- Implement combinational logic for ADD, SUB, AND, OR operations.
- Include an operation selector (at least 2 bits) to choose the operation.
- Create a testbench to verify all operations with sample inputs.
- Document the module interface (inputs, outputs, control signals).
