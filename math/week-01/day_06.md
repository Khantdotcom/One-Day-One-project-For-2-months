Day 06 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Maxima/Minima for Functions of Two Variables (Second Derivative Test).
DM Topic: Number Theory: Properties of Even/Odd Integers.
DS Topic: Karnaugh Maps (K-Map) for 3 Variables.

Digital Product:
- DE: Find and classify critical points for a given function using Python, including Hessian matrix calculation.
- DM: Proof document for two number theory theorems (e.g., product of two odd numbers is odd).
- DS: Design a 3-input logic circuit, derive minimal SOP/POS form using K-Maps, and simulate the result.
