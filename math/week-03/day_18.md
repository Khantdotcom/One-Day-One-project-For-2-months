Day 18 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Higher-Order DE: Nonhomogeneous Equations (Variation of Parameters).
DM Topic: Combinatorics: Pigeonhole Principle (PHP).
DS Topic: JK and T Flip-Flops.

Digital Product:
- DE: Implement Variation of Parameters method to find y_p for a second-order DE.
- DM: Document two example problems solved using the Generalized Pigeonhole Principle.
- DS: Simulate the JK and T flip-flops and demonstrate how to convert a JK to a T.
