Day 42 — DE/DS Integration

Project: Circuit Simulation: Implement the RLC circuit in a logic simulator (e.g., using digital blocks to represent the analog components or a simplified digital control).

Digital Product:
- Implement or simulate the RLC circuit response using a circuit simulator (e.g., LTspice, Logisim analog blocks, or Python NumPy/SciPy).
- Compare the digital/simulated response to the analytical solution from Day 41.
- Generate timing diagrams or waveform plots showing voltage and current over time.
- Document the simulation methodology and results.
