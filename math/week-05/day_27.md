Day 27 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Capstone Project Prep (DE).
DM Topic: Recurrence Relations: Defining Sequences Recursively.
DS Topic: Asynchronous State Machine Issues (Setup/Hold Times).

Digital Product:
- DE: Outline and gather data/parameters for a DE-based project (e.g., predator-prey system).
- DM: Python script to generate the first 10 terms of recursively defined sequences (e.g., Fibonacci).
- DS: A summary document explaining the concepts of setup time, hold time, and clock skew in synchronous circuits.
