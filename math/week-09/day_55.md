Day 55 — DS/HDL/Programming

Project: Traffic Light Controller (Sequential DS Focus): Design the State Diagram and State Table for a two-way traffic light controller.

Digital Product:
- Design a state machine for a simple two-way traffic intersection (North-South and East-West).
- Define states: NS_GREEN (N-S green, E-W red), NS_YELLOW, EW_GREEN, EW_YELLOW.
- Set up timers for each state (e.g., 30 seconds green, 5 seconds yellow).
- Create a complete state diagram with transitions and timing conditions.
- Document the state table with next state and output logic.
