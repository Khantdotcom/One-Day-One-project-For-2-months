Day 57 — DM/DE/Programming

Project: Complexity Analysis of Numerical Solvers: Analyze the Big-O complexity of the RK4 algorithm (DM focus).

Digital Product:
- Analyze the time complexity of RK4: count the number of function evaluations per step and the total number of steps.
- Document the Big-O notation for RK4 (typically O(n) where n is the number of steps required for a target accuracy).
- Analyze space complexity (storage for intermediate results).
- Compare RK4 complexity to Euler's method and higher-order methods (e.g., RK5).
- Create a table showing empirical runtime vs. step size for the solvers implemented in Days 51–52.
- Discuss practical implications: accuracy vs. computation time trade-offs.
