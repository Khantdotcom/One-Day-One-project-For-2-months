Day 29 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: DE Project Work: Numerical Solver and Plotting.
DM Topic: Recurrence Relations: Solving Nonhomogeneous Relations.
DS Topic: DS Project Work: Combinational Core Design.

Digital Product:
- DE: Use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp to numerically solve the system and plot the phase portrait.
- DM: Solve one nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation using the method of undetermined coefficients.
- DS: Design and simulate the combinational part of the DS project (e.g., the logic unit of an ALU).
