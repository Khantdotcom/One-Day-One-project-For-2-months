Day 59 — All Subjects Wrap-up

Product: Final Project Integration: Create a presentation/GitHub repository showcasing the three main digital products (DE Solver, DM Proof/Algorithm, DS Logic/HDL).

Digital Product:
- Organize all deliverables from Phases 1–3 into a GitHub repository (or similar version control).
- Create a comprehensive README that explains each project, its objectives, and key results.
- Include links to or embed the code repositories for DE solvers (RK4, Lotka-Volterra), DM projects (tautology checker, MST solver, GCD machine), and DS projects (ALU, traffic light controller).
- Create a visual summary or presentation (slides, infographic, or video) showcasing the work.
- Document the integration: how the three subjects complemented and enhanced each other during the 60-day cycle.
