Day 12 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: First-Order DE: Separable Equations.
DM Topic: Functions: Bijections and Inverse Functions.
DS Topic: Implementing Logic Functions using MUX (VEM Method).

Digital Product:
- DE: Python script to solve and plot the solution of a separable DE with an initial condition.
- DM: Write a Python function to find the inverse of a simple bijective function.
- DS: Design and simulate a 4-variable function using only a single 8-to-1 MUX.
