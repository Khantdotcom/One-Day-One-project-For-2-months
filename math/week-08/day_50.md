Day 50 — DM/DS Integration

Project: GCD State Machine Simulation: Design and simulate the state machine (State Diagram, State Table, logic) for the GCD algorithm.

Digital Product:
- Implement the GCD state machine in a logic simulator or HDL (Verilog/VHDL).
- Create test cases with sample inputs (e.g., GCD(48, 18), GCD(100, 35)).
- Generate a timing diagram showing state transitions, register updates, and output generation.
- Verify the correctness of the output by comparing with the analytical GCD result.
- Document the simulation results and any optimizations.
