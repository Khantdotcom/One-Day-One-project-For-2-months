Day 53 — DM/Programming

Project: Graph Algorithms/MST (DM Focus): Implement Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree.

Digital Product:
- Code Prim's algorithm from scratch using an adjacency matrix or adjacency list representation.
- Create a sample weighted graph (5-10 vertices) with edge weights.
- Trace the algorithm step-by-step and document the MST construction process.
- Output the MST edges, total weight, and a visualization of the tree.
- Compare with Kruskal's algorithm (briefly document differences).
