Day 11 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Introduction to Differential Equations (Definitions and Classification).
DM Topic: Functions: Domain, Codomain, Injection, Surjection.
DS Topic: Multiplexers (MUX) Design and Data Selection.

Digital Product:
- DE: Report on classifying 5 different sample ODEs by order, linearity, and homogeneity.
- DM: Implement a function checker in Python to test if a relation satisfies function properties (using sets).
- DS: Simulate an 8-to-1 MUX and demonstrate its data selection function.
