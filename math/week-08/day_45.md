Day 45 — DE/Programming

Project: Predator-Prey System Refinement (DE Focus): Implement the Lotka-Volterra equations as a system of ODEs.

Digital Product:
- Set up the Lotka-Volterra system: dx/dt = αx - βxy and dy/dt = δxy - γy.
- Implement the system as a Python function compatible with scipy.integrate.
- Prepare numerical solver setup with initial conditions.
- Document the system and parameter choices with biological interpretation.
