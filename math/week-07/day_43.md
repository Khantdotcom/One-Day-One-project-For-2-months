Day 43 — DM/Programming

Project: Automated Theorem Prover (DM Focus): Start building a simple proof checker for tautologies in propositional logic using a truth table generator.

Digital Product:
- Design a simple propositional logic parser (parse formulas like "A AND (B OR C)").
- Implement a truth table generator to evaluate all possible assignments.
- Create a tautology checker function.
- Test with several sample formulas and document the approach.
