Day 02 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Applications of Partial Derivatives (e.g., tangent planes).
DM Topic: Proof by Contrapositive/Contradiction.
DS Topic: Basic Logic Gates (NOT, AND, OR).

Digital Product:
- DE: 3D plot of a surface and its tangent plane at a point using Python/Matplotlib.
- DM: Document two example proofs using contrapositive and contradiction (e.g., proving √2 is irrational).
- DS: Simulate truth tables for NOT/AND/OR gates in a digital logic simulator or Python script.
