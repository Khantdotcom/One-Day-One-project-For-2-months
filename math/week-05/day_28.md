Day 28 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: DE Project Work: Model Implementation.
DM Topic: Recurrence Relations: Solving Homogeneous Linear Relations.
DS Topic: DS Project Prep.

Digital Product:
- DE: Implement the system of ODEs in Python, preparing for numerical solution.
- DM: Document the general solution for 3 homogeneous linear recurrence relations.
- DS: Outline and select tools/components for a DS-based project (e.g., a simple ALU).
