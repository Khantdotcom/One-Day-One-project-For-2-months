Day 56 — DS/HDL/Programming

Project: Controller HDL: Write the HDL code for the sequential logic (flip-flops, state transitions) of the traffic light controller.

Digital Product:
- Write Verilog or VHDL for the traffic light controller state machine.
- Implement the state register (using flip-flops) and next-state logic combinationally.
- Add a clock and reset signal for synchronous operation.
- Implement a timer or counter module to handle state duration.
- Create a testbench that simulates a full traffic cycle (NS green → yellow → EW green → yellow, repeat).
- Generate timing diagrams showing light changes.
