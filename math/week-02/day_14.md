Day 14 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Modeling: Population Growth (Exponential/Logistic Models).
DM Topic: Relations: Equivalence Relations.
DS Topic: Programmable Logic Devices (PLD) Concepts (PROM, PAL, PLA).

Digital Product:
- DE: A Python simulation of a logistic growth model, comparing it to an exponential model.
- DM: Document the proof that a given relation (e.g., x ≡ y (mod n)) is an equivalence relation.
- DS: A brief report summarizing the differences in fixed/programmable arrays for PROM, PAL, and PLA.
