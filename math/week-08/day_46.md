Day 46 — DE/Programming

Project: Phase Portrait Plotter: Python script to solve and plot the phase portrait (trajectories) for the Lotka-Volterra model.

Digital Product:
- Use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp or odeint to numerically solve the Lotka-Volterra system.
- Generate multiple trajectories with different initial conditions.
- Create a phase portrait plot (x vs. y, showing the limit cycle).
- Add equilibrium point analysis and vector field visualization.
- Document the results and biological implications.
