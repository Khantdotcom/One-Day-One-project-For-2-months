Day 24 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Step Functions and Discontinuous Forcing Functions.
DM Topic: Graph Theory: Cycles and Euler Circuits.
DS Topic: Sequential Circuit Analysis (Given Circuit → State Table/Diagram).

Digital Product:
- DE: Plot a step function and a piecewise function using Python.
- DM: Report on determining if a graph has an Euler path or circuit (using graph visualization).
- DS: Analyze a provided sequential circuit and derive its State Table and State Diagram.
