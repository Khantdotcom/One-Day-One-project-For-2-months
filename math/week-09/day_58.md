Day 58 — DM/DE/Programming

Project: Complexity Report: Document the complexity analysis of RK4 and compare its efficiency to a simpler Euler method.

Digital Product:
- Create a comprehensive report comparing RK4 and Euler methods.
- Include theoretical complexity analysis (Big-O notation for time and space).
- Include empirical runtime comparisons: solve the same ODE with both methods at various step sizes.
- Measure accuracy (error vs. analytical solution) and runtime for each method.
- Create graphs: (1) error vs. step size for both methods, (2) runtime vs. step size.
- Conclusions: when to use RK4 vs. Euler (accuracy needs, computational constraints).
- Document the practical applicability in scientific computing and engineering applications.
