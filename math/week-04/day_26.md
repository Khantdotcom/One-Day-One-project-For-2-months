Day 26 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Solving Systems: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
DM Topic: Graph Theory: Planar Graphs and Euler's Formula.
DS Topic: Mealy and Moore Models (Concepts and Conversion).

Digital Product:
- DE: Python script using NumPy to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 2x2 coefficient matrix.
- DM: Report with examples of planar and non-planar graphs, verifying Euler's Formula (v - e + f = 2).
- DS: Convert a simple Moore-model State Diagram to an equivalent Mealy-model diagram and document the difference.
