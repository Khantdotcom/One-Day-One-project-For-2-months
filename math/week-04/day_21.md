Day 21 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Introduction to Laplace Transform.
DM Topic: Graph Theory: Basic Definitions (Vertices, Edges, Degree).
DS Topic: Counters: Synchronous Counter Design.

Digital Product:
- DE: Compute the Laplace transform of a simple function using SymPy.
- DM: Implement a simple graph data structure in Python and compute the degree of each node.
- DS: Design and simulate a 4-bit Synchronous Up Counter using D flip-flops and logic gates.
