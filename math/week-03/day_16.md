Day 16 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Higher-Order DE: Homogeneous Linear Equations (Constant Coefficients).
DM Topic: Complexity Theory: Big-O Notation (Definitions).
DS Topic: Sequential Circuits: Introduction to State Machines.

Digital Product:
- DE: Python script to find the characteristic equation and general solution for 3 sample homogeneous DEs (real distinct, repeated, complex roots).
- DM: Document a proof for a Big-O relationship (e.g., 5x^2 + 3x = O(x^2)).
- DS: Draw and document the State Diagram and State Table for a simple sequence detector (e.g., detect "101").
