Day 01 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Partial Derivatives. (yes, partially)
DM Topic: Trivial/Vacuous/Direct Proofs.
DS Topic: Binary, Octal, Hex Systems.

Digital Product:
- DE: Python function to compute f_x(x, y) and f_y(x, y) for a given symbolic function (SymPy example).
- DM: Document three example proofs (one trivial, one vacuous, one direct) in Markdown/LaTeX.
- DS: Python script for base conversion (up to Hexadecimal).
