Day 19 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Modeling: Mass-Spring System (Free Undamped Motion).
DM Topic: Combinatorics: Integer Solutions to Equations.
DS Topic: Registers: Serial and Parallel Load/Shift.

Digital Product:
- DE: Python simulation of a mass-spring system (simple harmonic oscillator), plotting position over time.
- DM: Python script to solve a simple allocation problem (Stars and Bars/integer solutions).
- DS: Simulate a 4-bit Serial-In/Parallel-Out Shift Register and demonstrate its operation.
