Day 20 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Modeling: Mass-Spring System (Forced/Damped Motion).
DM Topic: Combinatorics: Generating Functions (Basic Concepts).
DS Topic: Counters: Asynchronous (Ripple) Counter.

Digital Product:
- DE: Modify the simulation to include damping and a forcing function, analyzing the change in the plot.
- DM: Report on the concept of generating functions and their use for solving simple counting problems.
- DS: Simulate a 4-bit Asynchronous Up Counter and observe its timing diagram.
