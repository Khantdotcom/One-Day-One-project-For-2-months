Day 22 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Inverse Laplace Transform.
DM Topic: Graph Theory: Edge-Sum Theorem and Odd Nodes.
DS Topic: Mod-N Synchronous Counter Design.

Digital Product:
- DE: Compute the inverse Laplace transform for two common transforms (e.g., 1/(s^2+1), 1/(s-a)).
- DM: Proof document for the Edge-Sum Theorem and the property of an even number of odd-degree nodes.
- DS: Design and simulate a MOD-5 counter (counting 0-4) using JK flip-flops.
