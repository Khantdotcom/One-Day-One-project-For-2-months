Day 33 — DE/DM/DS

DE Topic: Differential Equations Review.
DM Topic: DM Project Work: Proof/Logic Implementation.
DS Topic: Register/FF Lab Review (Serial/Parallel I/O, Divisibility Check).

Digital Product:
- DE: Review solutions to first-order and higher-order DEs.
- DM: Implement the logic for the proof/solver part (e.g., checking if a set of axioms leads to a contradiction).
- DS: Simulate a shift register configured to perform the "divisibility by 7" check from the lab.
