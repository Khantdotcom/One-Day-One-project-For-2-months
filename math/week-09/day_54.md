Day 54 — DM/Programming

Project: MST Solver: Python script that takes a graph (adjacency list/matrix) and outputs the MST.

Digital Product:
- Build a comprehensive MST solver that accepts various graph input formats (adjacency matrix, edge list, or interactive input).
- Implement both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms as options.
- Create a user-friendly interface to input graphs and view results.
- Test with multiple sample graphs (complete graphs, sparse graphs, weighted graphs).
- Generate a visualization of the original graph and the resulting MST.
- Document the time complexity and practical applications (network design, etc.).
