Day 47 — DS/HDL/Programming

Project: 4-bit ALU Design (DS Focus): Design the full circuit diagram for a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

Digital Product:
- Outline the ALU's functionality: basic operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR), and selection logic.
- Design the combinational circuit for each operation using basic gates.
- Create or sketch the circuit diagram (hand-drawn or using a tool like CircuitLab, Logisim, or Qucs).
- Document the truth table for the operation selector and signal propagation.
